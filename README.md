# My Portfolio

This is designed to showcase my skills in HTML and CSS, especially flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I have used placeholders for web applications until I have some to use, and will continue to add to it over the next few months.

When my portfolio is loaded, presented is my name, a recent photo, and links to sections About Me, my Work, and Contact Info.  Clicking one of the links in the navigation bar, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.  Clicking on the link to the section about my Work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications.  When presented with my first application, that application's image is larger in size than the others.  Clicking on the images of my applications, will take the user to that deployed application.  When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices, a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport is presented.
